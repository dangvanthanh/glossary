Proof Key for Code Exchange is an extension to the OAuth protocol that enables secure exchange of refresh and access tokens between an application (web app, single-page app or mobile app) and the authorization server. It is used in places where the exchange of the refresh and access token may be intercepted by third parties such as other applications running in the operating system. This is a common problem on mobile devices where the operating system may hand out URLs to other applications. This can sometimes be also exploited in single-page apps too.
