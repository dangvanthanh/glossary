Strong eventual consistency (SEC) is formal consistency model for CRDTs. It requires convergence (see above) and eventual delivery (if one replica has processed an update, every other replica that has not failed will also eventually process it). See Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types by Marc Shapiro, Nuno Pregui√ßa, Carlos Baquero, and Marek Zawirski.
