SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is a protocol that enables single-sign on for enterprises. SAML was invented in the early 2000s and is based on XML technology. It is the de-facto standard for enabling single-sign on for enterprises, although the more recent OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol is gaining popularity.
