JWTs issued by Supabase are signed using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. The secret key used in the signing is called the JWT signing secret. You should not share this secret with someone or some thing you don't trust, nor should you post it publicly. Anyone with access to the secret can create arbitrary JWTs.
