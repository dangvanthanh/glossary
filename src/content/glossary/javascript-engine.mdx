What are commonly referred to as JavaScript engines could more accurately be called ECMAScript engines, because they implement ECMA-262 without any (or much) additional functionality. A JavaScript engine is meant to be embedded in a host, which in turn defines additional functionality for input and output. The best known JavaScript engines are:

- V8 - Created as the JavaScript engine for the Chromium project and is now also used in Node.js and Deno. Because Edge and Opera are based on Chromium, V8 is the most frequently used JavaScript engine.
- SpiderMonkey - The JavaScript engine for Firefox.
- JavaScriptCore - Created as the JavaScript engine for Safari, both on MacOS and in iOS, and is also used in Bun.

Because JavaScript engines only implement ECMAScript and are meant to be extended by a host, they can be used in a variety of different runtime environments.
