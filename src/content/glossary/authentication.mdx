Authentication (often abbreviated authn.) is the process of verifying the identity of a user. Verification of the identity of a user can happen in multiple ways:

- Asking users for something they know. For example: password, passphrase.
- Checking that users have access to something they own. For example: an email address, a phone number, a hardware key, recovery codes.
- Confirming that users have some biological features. For example: a fingerprint, a certain facial structure, an iris print.
