Optimistic replication is an approach to replication in which a replica can process updates locally, without waiting for communication with other replicas. This means that replicas can become temporarily inconsistent, but CRDTs ensure that replicas nevertheless converge towards a consistent state (see Strong Eventual Consistency). See Optimistic Replication by Yasushi Saito and Marc Shapiro.
