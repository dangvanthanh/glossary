Password hashing functions are specially-designed algorithms that allow web servers to verify a password without storing it as-is. Unlike other difficult to guess strings generated from secure random number generators, passwords are picked by users and often are easy to guess by attackers. These algorithms slow down and make it very costly for attackers to guess passwords.

There are three generally accepted password hashing functions: Argon2, bcrypt and scrypt.
