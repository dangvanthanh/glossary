An identity provider is software or service that allows third-party applications to identify users without the exchange of passwords. Social login and enterprise single-sign on won't be possible without identity providers.

Social login platforms typically use the OAuth protocol, while enterprise single-sign on is based on the OIDC or SAML protocols.
