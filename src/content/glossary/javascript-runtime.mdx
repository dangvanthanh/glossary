A JavaScript runtime is an ECMAScript host, meaning that it is a program that embeds a JavaScript engine. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Node.js, Deno, and Bun are all JavaScript runtimes because they embed a JavaScript engine and define additional functionality that is accessible through JavaScript. The web browsers implement the DOM and other web APIs while the server-side runtimes implement file system access.
