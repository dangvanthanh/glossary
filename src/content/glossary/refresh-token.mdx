A refresh token is a long-lived (in most cases with an indefinite lifetime) token that is meant to be stored and exchanged for a new refresh and access tokens only once. Once a refresh token is exchanged it becomes invalid, and can't be exchanged again. In practice, though, a refresh token can be exchanged multiple times but in a short time window.
