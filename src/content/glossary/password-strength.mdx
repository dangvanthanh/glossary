Password strength is a measurement of how difficult a password is to guess. Simple measurement includes calculating the number of possibilities given the types of characters used in the password. For example a password of only letters has fewer variations than ones with letters and digits. Better measurements include strategies such as looking for similarity to words, phrases or already known passwords.
