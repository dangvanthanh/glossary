A JSON Web Token is a type of data structure, represented as a string, that usually contains identity and authorization information about a user. It encodes information about its lifetime and is signed with cryptographic key making it tamper resistant.

Access tokens are JWTs and by inspecting the information they contain you can allow or deny access to resources. Row level security policies are based on the information present in JWTs.
